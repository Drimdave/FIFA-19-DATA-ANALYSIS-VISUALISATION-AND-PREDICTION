For this project, we would do an end to end walkthrough process of analysing, visualizing and predicting a dataset called the FIFA 19 Game Dataset. The simple analytical process will include some steps for exploring, cleaning our dataset and visualizing, some steps for predicting player performance using basic statistics, and some steps for grouping similar clusters using machine learning.
